# 📚 DataStructures – Interactive Data Structures System in C++

This project offers implementations of fundamental data structures in C++ and provides a simple text-based interface for interactive testing directly from the terminal.

---

## 🧩 Project Features

- 🧱 **Dynamic Data Structures**: Implementations include:
  - Dynamic Array
  - Singly Linked List with 
  - Doubly Linked List
- 🧠 **Manual Memory Management**: Emphasis on understanding memory allocation without relying on the Standard Template Library (STL).
- 🖥️ **Interactive Console Menu**: Navigate and perform operations on data structures through a user-friendly terminal interface.
- 📂 **Organized Directory Structure**:
  - `structures/`: Contains implementations of various data structures.
  - `menu/`: Manages the display and functionality of the console menu.
  - `data/`: Holds sample data and test structures.
  - `utilities/`: Includes helper functions such as data validation and messaging.

## 📂 Folder Overview

- **`structures/`** – Implementations of data structures (e.g., dynamic array, singly linked list, doubly linked list).
- **`menu/`** – Code responsible for displaying and handling the console menu.
- **`data/`** – Sample data, test structures, and placeholder functions.
- **`utilities/`** – Helper functions like data validation and messaging.
- **`main.cpp`** – Entry point of the application, integrating all components into a functional menu-driven program.

## 🧪 How It Works

When you run the application, an interactive **console menu** is displayed. It allows users to select a data structure and perform various operations such as insertion, deletion, and display.
