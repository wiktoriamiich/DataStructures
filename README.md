# 📚 DataStructures – Interactive Data Structures System in C++

This project provides an interactive terminal-based system to experiment with key dynamic data structures in C++. It's designed to help users understand how each structure works under the hood, test them in real time, and compare their performance in different scenarios.

## 🧩 What does the project include?

- 🧱 **Implemented data structures**:
  - Singly linked list *(with and without tail pointer)*
  - Doubly linked list
  - Dynamic array
- 🧠 **Manual memory management** – implemented without using the STL
- 🖥️ **Interactive console menu** – choose structures and operations
- ⏱️ **Benchmarking** – measures execution time of each operation
- 📊 **Theoretical validation** – most time complexities match theoretical expectations
- 💡 **Educational design** – explore internal mechanics and practical trade-offs
- 🧰 **Object-Oriented Principles**:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction

## 📂 Folder Overview

- **`structures/`** – Implementations of the data structures
- **`menu/`** – Interactive terminal menu logic
- **`data/`** – Sample/test data and structure templates
- **`utilities/`** – Helper functions (input validation, messages, etc.)
- **`main.cpp`** – Entry point that connects all components

---

## 🧪 How It Works

When launched, the application displays an **interactive console menu** where you can:

- Choose a data structure to work with
- Perform operations like `pushBack`, `popBack`, `find`, `insert`, `delete`, etc.
- See live feedback/results in the terminal
- Benchmark and compare performance across different structures
