# 📚 DataStructures – Interactive Data Structures System in C++

This project provides implementations of fundamental data structures in C++ and a simple text-based interface that allows interactive testing of these structures directly from the terminal.

---

## 🧩 What does the project include?

- 🧱 **Dynamic data structures**: e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues *(in progress)*
- 🧠 **Manual memory management** – no STL usage
- 🖥️ **Interactive console menu** – choose structures and operations
- 📂 Clean folder structure: `structures/`, `menu/`, `data/`, `utilities/`

## 📂 Project Structure

| Folder        | Contents                                                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `structures/` | Implementations of data structures (e.g., singly/doubly linked lists)       |
| `menu/`       | Code responsible for displaying and handling the console menu               |
| `data/`       | Sample data / test structures / placeholder functions                       |
| `utilities/`  | Helper functions (e.g., data validation, messages)                          |
| `main.cpp`    | Entry point of the application, integrates all components into a working menu |

## 🧪 How does it work?

After launching the program, an interactive **console menu** is displayed, allowing you to choose a data structure and perform operations on it.
